Au cours de la visite, et alors que Kimberley, accompagn\u00e9e de son cadreur et de son preneur de son, observe la salle des op\u00e9rations de la centrale, les visiteurs deviennent les t\u00e9moins d'un incident nucl\u00e9aire, voyant comment le personnel de la salle s'active pour tenter d'en venir \u00e0 bout. Le cadreur de Kimberley, Richard Adams, filme secr\u00e8tement l'incident. Adams montre ensuite les images \u00e0 un ing\u00e9nieur nucl\u00e9aire ext\u00e9rieur, qui confirme la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement et son caract\u00e8re potentiellement dangereux.
