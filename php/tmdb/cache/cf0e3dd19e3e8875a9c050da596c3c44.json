Il se pr\u00e9sente sous la forme de diff\u00e9rents chapitres retra\u00e7ant l'apparition de ce genre, ses codes, ses sous-genres, ses modes de vie et m\u00eame ses d\u00e9rives (black metal notamment). Le r\u00e9alisateur essaye \u00e9galement de d\u00e9truire certains clich\u00e9s stigmatisant ce milieu tout en restant le plus impartial possible et en faisant intervenir un grand nombre de t\u00e9moins venus de diff\u00e9rents horizons (musiciens ou
